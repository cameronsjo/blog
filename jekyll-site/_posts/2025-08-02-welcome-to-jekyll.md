# Welcome to Your Jekyll Blog!

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

## Getting Started

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter.

### Code Highlighting

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Jekyll')
#=> prints 'Hi, Jekyll' to STDOUT.
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) for more info.
