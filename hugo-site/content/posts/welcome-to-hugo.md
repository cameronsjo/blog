# Welcome to Your Hugo Blog!

You'll find this post in your `content/posts` directory. Hugo builds sites incredibly fast and offers great flexibility.

## Getting Started

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `content/posts` directory with proper front matter.

### Code Highlighting

Hugo offers excellent code highlighting:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
```

Check out the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for more information.
